📌 Customer Churn Prediction (85% Accuracy) 🚀

This project predicts customer churn using Machine Learning (ML) with Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

🔹 Key Features

✅ 85% Accuracy with Random Forest after hyperparameter tuning
✅ Handles Missing Data & Class Imbalance using SMOTE
✅ Feature Scaling using StandardScaler
✅ Feature Importance Visualization
✅ Saves Model & Scaler for Future Predictions

🔹 How It Works

1️⃣ Preprocess Data (Convert categorical values, handle missing data)
2️⃣ Apply SMOTE (Fix class imbalance in churn data)
3️⃣ Train ML Models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
4️⃣ Optimize Hyperparameters (GridSearchCV)
5️⃣ Save Best Model & Scaler (joblib)
6️⃣ Predict New Customer Churn using saved model

🔹 Example Prediction Output

🔹 Churn Probability: 0.72
🔹 Churn Prediction: Yes

📌 Next Steps: If you want a high-accuracy and dynamic system, you can go with deep learning🤖
